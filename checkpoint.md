# Checkpoints

# V.0.0.0.1-alpha
* Working on about 50% PJRTError compatibility across all pjrt wrappers
* Left the tests untouched once full &rt is implemented across layers
* Working towards more api completeness against pjrt_c_api_h, writing more callables that are needed


Once more stability is present, there will be more on external configurations, as of right now,
api is pointer-heavy, and goal is to minimize or to abstract that.
